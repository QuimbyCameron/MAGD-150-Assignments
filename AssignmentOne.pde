This was the very first code I had to write for this class. I adhered to the theme Space and instantly thought of planets. I was
struggling with figuring out the placements for ellipses so I tried a new sketch that contained an astronaut placing a flag on the 
moon. I think, especially for my first code that displays an image, it went very well.
Below is the code.



void setup(){
  size(400, 400);
}
void draw(){
  background(50);
  rect(0, 0, 400, 200);
  rect(150, 200, 100, 150);
  rect(130, 210, 20, 100);
  rect(250, 210, 20, 100);
  rect(150, 350, 40, 150);
  rect(210, 350, 40, 150);
  rect(310, 50, 10, 150);
  rect(320, 50, 60, 40);
  rect(320, 50, 30, 20);
  point(325, 55);
  point(330, 55);
  point(335, 55);
  point(340, 55);
  point(345, 55);
  point(325, 60);
  point(330, 60);
  point(335, 60);
  point(340, 60);
  point(345, 60);
  point(325, 65);
  point(330, 65);
  point(335, 65);
  point(340, 65);
  point(345, 65);
  line(350, 60, 380, 60);
  line(350, 70, 380, 70);
  line(320, 80, 380, 80);
ellipse(200, 150, 150, 150);
noFill();
  ellipse(200, 150, 100, 100);
  ellipse(200, 150, 90, 90);
  fill(255);
  rect(175, 250, 50, 50);
  ellipse(190, 270, 15, 15);
  ellipse(210, 270, 15, 15);
  ellipse(210, 290, 10, 10);
  ellipse(190, 290, 10, 10);
}
